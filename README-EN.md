Steps to Set Up and Use the Project:

1. Webpack Configuration (Webpack.config)
This project uses Webpack as its primary tool for building and bundling. The Webpack configuration can be found in the webpack.config.js file and is optimized for various environments.

2. Transpile ES6 with Babel
Babel is used to transpile ES6 code into ES5 for compatibility with older browsers. The Babel configuration is located in the .babelrc file.

3. Imports
You can use ES6 module imports to organize and manage your code more efficiently.

4. Lightweight Web Server (webpack-dev-server)
The project uses webpack-dev-server to create a local development server. You can start the server with npm start and access your application at http://localhost:8080.

5. Automatic Build Generation and Script Assignment to HTML (HTMLWebpackPlugin)
The HTMLWebpackPlugin plugin automatically generates the HTML file with scripts and links them to the Webpack compilation. The HTML template file is located in the src folder.

6. CSS Management
This project uses CSS modules to encapsulate styles and prevent conflicts. CSS files can be imported directly into JavaScript components.

7. Twitter Bootstrap Library Installation
Bootstrap has been integrated into the project to facilitate design and layout. You can customize Bootstrap to fit your needs in the SASS configuration file.

8. SASS Configuration
The project uses SASS as a CSS preprocessor. Styles are located in the src/styles folder and can be customized to your preferences.

9. Refactoring of Project Structure (src folder)
The src folder contains the base structure of the project. You can efficiently organize your components, styles, and other resources within this folder.

10. Working with Images
You can manage and use images in your project. Place images in the src/assets folder and then import them into your code.

11. React Configuration
If you want to use React, this project includes an initial React configuration. You can start developing your React components right away.

12. Configuration and Usage of CSS Modules
CSS modules allow effective style isolation to avoid collisions. Support for CSS modules is included in the Webpack configuration.

13. TypeScript: Environment and Different Scenarios
If you prefer to use TypeScript, the project is also compatible. TypeScript configuration can be found in the tsconfig.json file.

14. Different Webpack Configurations or Profiles (Development / Production)
Different Webpack profiles have been set up for development and production environments. You can build your application for production using npm run build.

15. Environment Variables
You can define specific environment variables in the .env file to manage sensitive or custom configurations.

16. Bundle Weight Statistics (Bundle Analyzer)
The project includes the Bundle Analyzer plugin to help you analyze the size of your bundles and optimize your application.
